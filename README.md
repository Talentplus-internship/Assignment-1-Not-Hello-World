# Assignment-1-Not-Hello-World
Assignment: write your first program

Steps: 
1. Install Python 
2. Install a programming text editor like vscode 

3. write a program that prints one line of a sentence/phrase other than 'hello world', 
4. Take a screenshot when you run your code successfully 
5. Create your own branch and commit your code with the screenshot in this GitHub repository https://github.com/Talentplus-internship/Assignment-1-Not-Hello-World. 

Note: 
You should use the command line app on your laptop to execute the Python program you wrote in the text editor. Please do *not* use the online Python playground, or the shortcut in your text editor to run the code. Later in the class when we start reading files, we will need to be able to run Python programs from particular directories. More details in todayâ€™s class.
